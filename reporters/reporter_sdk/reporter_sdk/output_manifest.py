"""Output ``manifest.json`` model and validated report-zip builder.

Every reporter writes a zip to ``COGAME_REPORT_URI``. The zip's
top-level ``manifest.json`` self-describes the report for downstream
consumers (Observatory, the platform's report viewer, future
aggregators):

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "reporter_id": "paint-arena-summarizer",
      "render": "summary.html",
      "event_log": "proximity.parquet",
      "trace": "trace.jsonl"
    }

``render`` is optional and at most one entry; if set it must point at an
in-zip ``.md`` or ``.html`` entry. ``event_log`` is optional and at most
one entry; if set it must point at an in-zip ``.parquet`` entry. ``trace``
is optional and at most one entry; if set it must point at an in-zip
``.jsonl`` or ``.json`` entry. The validation in :func:`build_report_zip`
enforces all declared constraints before
the zip is produced — a misdeclared manifest is the kind of bug that
silently breaks the platform's report viewer, so reporters fail fast.

See metta's ``packages/coworld/src/coworld/docs/roles/reporter.md`` for
the canonical contract this implements.
